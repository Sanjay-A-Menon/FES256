# FES256
A fast and efficient implementation of a SHA256 cracker

## Implementation status ##
Have implemented a SHA256 hasher core at present, currently a 
version of the SHA256 cracker is been developed using this core.

## Introduction
Hardware implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic. The implementation 
is written in C++(Vivado HLS) compliant code.

The hardware implementation is complemented by a functional model
written in Python.

## Implementation details ##
- TODO


## Fpga-results ##

### Xilinx FPGAs ###

Implementation results using Vivado 2019.2.

**TUL PYNQ-Z2**
- Add implementation results


## TODO ##
- Complete documentation.
- Add implementation results of the SHA256 hasher on **PYNQ-Z2**.
- Implement the SHA256 cracker using the above developed hasher core.
- Try to implement the same design on ASIC/other FPGA's as well.
